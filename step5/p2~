[-]I bought this camera as a new blogger who wanted to add some color with photography. Unfortunately, I couldn't really make it work with this camera. I saw similar reviews on other Nikons about issues with focus and that's precisely the problem with this camera. I would go to take a picture, hold down the button halfway, and it would focus.
[-]While the camera is light, easily handled and quite portable, i found image quality to be severely lacking. Taking landscape images at 28 mm in full daylight (thus smallest aperture), i see significant distortion and fuzziness in various parts of the image. I have used numerous camera, and this has been the worst among those i have used over the years. I am very disappointed as my earlier experiences w Nikon have been good. I am returning this camera and shall probably replace with a comparable Canon model.I also found the auto focus to be slow to respond limit quick shooting.
[-]Made to mimic a dslr camera. It feels light and cheap in your hand. The lens has a great zoom but is otherwise not worth mentioning. I got it for work and the size and shape of the camera makes it impractical to carry around. Not impressed with Nikon this time.
[-]Honestly, a much cheaper camera would produce the same results as this one does. It's a decent camera, but I would buy a cheaper one in hindsight.
[-]so i just got this camera today, and honestly my 14 mp fujifilm finepix s3200 is 10x better than this camera. so for now since i got it today i am going to give it two stars, i am going to do a test shoot tomorrow and compare the two side by side. i am going to do indoor at night and day. and i am going to go outside and shoot night and day then ill compare the two and give an updated review of this product. here is a 2 picture i took with this camera today.
[-]Pictures are not sharp or well-focused. Definitely not the quality I expected.
[-]The camera came floating around in it's box with no foam or styrofoam. There were no directions or paperwork included.The camera was a gift...I sure hope it works. I was completely embarrassed by the packaging. It looked like it may have been refurbished and resold. Very disappointed. I need the paperwork and the instructions for use and also the warranty.
[-]Stupid camera lost all my pictures
[-]If you happen to turn on the camera without removing the lens cap, this camera will break itself. I know that is my fault for making this mistake, but think about how many people will also do this same thing. It's a very easy mistake to make and I think the camera could have been designed better. It shouldn't be so easy to break. Otherwise, it's an EXCELLENT camera that I can't use now. It's not even a good doorstop.... too light, too small
[-]"The camera was not working correctly and the flash status could not be changed. The package appeared to have been opened before and it might have been previously returned. I returned it !"
[-]Every picture is blurry
[-]would not reccommend...grainy photo- horrible focus. Worth shelling out 50 bucks more for the l840. don't waste your time.
[-]Sent camera back didn't like quality of pictures
[-]I was very excited for my wife to take professional photos of my baby daughter but honestly our I phone has better resolution not happy
[-]This camera quality is worse than most phones. Super grainy and always blurry. My iPhone 5 takes far superior pictures.
[-]no memory card including
[-]Trash. I returned it.
[-]Was working great but can't get it to move to home page now. What should I do?
[-]It's to dificult finde a case cover in muy country
[-]does not have back lighting - a feature that almost all devices like it have.
[-]When ordering, I failed to realize that this model did not have a back-lit screen. Since I like to read at night, this was not the model for me. I returned it, and ordered another model that works better for me.
[-]Still too limited in what it can do.
[-]What the hell is going on at Xiaomi ? Same spec, same design and worst of of when all the other phones are moving to Android Marshmallow, but they are still stuck with Kit Kat. Piece of crap.. they seem to be dumping useless, unmarketable devices from China to India.. my Advice: DON'T buy this crap !!!!
[-]Sound is below horrible doesn't have any treble what so ever. The bass is weak and the controller app doesn't even work on Android devices. 
[-]I order this item using my Amazon dash button. The price has increased to $12 for 12 gatorades. This is $1 a piece. Not that great of a deal. I know the button is convenient, but that's a little expensive, especially for the smaller bottle.
[-]I have two of these cards and bought them to use with a Canon 60D. My camera manual calls for class 6 or better. I thought I was saving money buying the transcend Class 10 for less than the SanDisk Class 6. This card is not capable of recording HD video on the 60D. It is not fast enough. After a couple seconds of shooting video the camera shows an ons creen indicator that looks like a buffer filling and ceases recording.
[-]It's a good thing I have an HDX Kindle so I was able to get the thing on the internet otherwise it is a unless piece of junk. Called Amazon all they would do is send a replacement unit. The unit does not have an app to adjust the tone so what you hear is what you get!! Junk audio!! Useless without the internet!!
[-]Hate it
[-]It's a gadget. Maybe a toy. It does play music, if it understands what you're asking for, and if you'd rather hear your music out of a little bluetooth speaker instead of your sound system.. Almost useless for searches. It was fun to play with for a while.
[-]The one single great waste of money I've probably ever sent I my lifetime. If you "never" tire of hearing the phrase: "Humm I can't find the answer to the question I heard" then you'll love this large black useless paperweight. Do yourself a favor and use your money on something that is either useful or enjoyable. Buying an Amazon Echo shall only bring you dissatisfaction and quite often fits of anger.
[-]Mine doesn't work very well . Doesn't know most things I ask and doesn't hear me very well . I have a great room and she's in the middle of it.
[-]Was excited to get Echo but she does not do that much. 75% of the time she cannot answer my questions, disappointed
[-]Works great as a radio and to keep track of shopping list. You have to be very specific when you ask a question and you must tell it which app it needs to use to achieve what you ask. Wish it was more capable like siri or google.
[-]Too hard to use at such a large price wihtout a WiFi TV
[-]not for europe
[-]It did not come with the remote.
[-]I have to stand right next to echo in order for it to hear. Not what we expected and not sure if it's just defective. Cool idea IF it could actually hear me when the music was playing or when I speak and am 5 steps away.
[-]it dosn't play with my music or connect with my phone
[-]I would like it to do more things that would be useful to me such as, turn on and off my smart tv, record shows at my request, make reservations for shows, movies or restaurants online, turn my car on in the morning at my request. Things like that. I hope they are working on stuff like that to improve Echo.The only thing I find useful now is the shopping list and playing music. (A little disappointed)
[-]expensive toy, nice speaker. be sure to try the fart app. turning lights on and off would be great but the equipment required to purchase is very expensive.
[-]The description of the product did not say you needed a smart phone to connect. I sent the product back for a full refund.
[-]Between good and above average.
[-]After much anticipation, I received my amazon Echo, but ended up very disappointed. I had trouble getting it to connect to my wireless network, but after several hours and resets, finally got it to connect. I worked very well thereafter, answering questions, getting the weather, playing music, etc. I was happy as a clam. However, after having left the room for several hours (I presume it went into "sleep" mode), it reported that it was "unable to connect to my network". I sat down and went through the agonizing process of attempting resets and reconnects (had to try several times), went online (Amazon's troubleshooting instructions are virtually useless) and found that this is a relatively common problem with few really good solutions other than attempting hard resets again and again. Eventually it worked and reconnected. However, you can guess the rest of the story.
[-]Not ready for prime time in my opinion. Can set a alarm, but can't make it repeating. Can't find clearly evident radio stations on tunein. Its just not ready to take on the world.
[-]So so speed, write and write, but product is good quality
[-]Purchased this with my Nikon coolpix S33 and it is not compatible with the camera. I am glad I gave myself plenty of time before my vacation to purchase this. I will be returning.
[-]Not What I thought it could do
[-]Plastic is cheap and cracked right away. Has trouble loading so I didn't trust it with my data.
[-]DO NOT PURCHASE THESE SHOES THEY ARE KNOCK OFFS!!
[-]I am very disappointed with what I received. The product looks nothing like the advertisement.
[-]The product looked nothing like the pic. It did not fit properly. Very easy to return.
[-]Horrible! Only half the box and that was dirty! Bag that shoes where in had holes and the shoes were also dirty!
[-]They aren't even real. Paid $80 for fake nikes.
[-]Bar arch support. I thought they must be too small so I ordered another size. Same problem with instant pain on the arches.
[-]Seems cheap and fake. Knock off Nike for sure. Never again buying Nike shoes online... Save your time and money.
[-]One shoe had a defect
[-]It is not original. But are nice
[-]The shoes are not what I was expecting.Other Nike shoes I've purchased I have simply put them on and run !!! But these are most uncomfortable and inferior Nike quality
[-]Gave the shoes to my daughter that has a narrow foot
[-]Uncomfortable:( very
[-]I didnt care for this shoe. I have bought Nike Flex previous but this were not as comfortable for some reason. The sole seemed very hard and stiff.
[-]I'm so annoyed. No ability to pivot and the sole does not flex....not good for running. Friend brought them over to China for me...so now I can't return them. Ugh....
[-]I ordered these shoes because I have a pair and wanted another. These are too narrow and don't fit the same at all.
[-]the opening is cut too high and irritated my ankles. Very disappointed. Not suitable for working out.
[-]I thought that I would love these shoes but they really make my feet hurt when I run.
[-]runs large, didnt return because it was too expensive and not worth it
[-]Returned. They did not provide the ability to pivot, which I need.
[-]Im pretty sure these are not real Nike's. For a sneaker they are pretty uncomfortable. I would not even consider working out in these. But non-the less I kept them & have received compliments on the shoe (mine were gray with an orange nike swoop). To bum around town they are fine but I do not think they should be $80.
[-]The shoes ran bigger than normal.
[-]Fit small, returned for refund
[-]The screen broke four days after I received it. Apparently HP touchscreens are notoriously defective and crack for no reason. I am so disappointed.
[-]I purchased 2 of these. One arrived with a snapped hinge between the monitor and the laptop base. I returned that immediately. The 2nd arrived in what appeared to be good condition. By day 2, the battery stopped working. I contacted support, and they resolved the issue remotely. Then a week later the battery stopped charging again, so I returned the second laptop, too. No longer going to be purchasing laptops from HP.
[-]Hello. I recently purchased this product and I am having some problems with it right out of the box. The two main issues that I've identified so far is 1) the display driver keeps crashing and then recovering. I'm not sure exactly what is causing this problem as I have tried extensively to make sure that all the drivers are up to date for the product. So if HP, or anyone else has a fix for this problem then i'd really like to hear it. 2) The computer is reporting that the battery is plugged in but not charging. I'd really like to hear from HP on how to fix these problems.
[-]For what is advertised as a flagship model it certainly disappoints it's extremely fragile, the door for the CD/DVD drive has popped off already. The driver graphics card has failed nearly every day promting yet another restart. The battery is not nearly what I expected it runs down over 60% within an hour and half. I'm sick of it frankly and will be looking for a refund or replacement at the very least.
[-]It all started with the "display driver has stopped responding and successfully recovered" error. I tried fixing it by visiting the HP support center, but it didn't help. After few days I started getting "Security check error" and the laptop was being restarted automatically. Now, some "Driver verification" error and had to restore to get my data back. Very disappointed with the quality of the laptop from HP. Have been facing a lot of issues from the very first day. Thanks Amazon for acknowledging my request and help me with the refund.
[-]I returned the first one and got it again. They both had imperfections in the LCD when I got them. Will be upgrading to a different brand.
[-]The computer is a decent computer, but there are quiet a few things that are satisfactory. First of all, the webpage says there will be 4 to 5 days for transportation, but I did not receive the computer until the 13th day I made my order. Another issue this computer has is the quality is so poor. In the day I received my computer, I discovered a crack on the edge of my computer, and it is very kind of annoying although the crack is not too visible.
[-]When I first received this computer, I loved the speed and the touchscreen was an added bonus. By day 4, I started receiving a drive error message no less than 8 times a day. I was only on the computer for about 4 hours a day. It also started making a loud grinding noise as early as day 1, but got louder each day. By day 10, the computer died.....!!!!!! Sent it back...Amazon refunded my purchase within 7 days. Love Amazon, but HP needs to address these issues.....a complete waste of my time and money.
[-]The one I get WAS TOTALLY MISERABLE ,Literally the worst laptop I have ever had in my entire life !!!!!I'm so so pissed off !!!!!Look I been scanning for solution at hp for more than half an hour now ,,, still scanning !!! ( they said this could take up to 3 minutes ...) MISERABLE
[-]One week old and already the blue screen of death. Not sure what's going on with it. Not happy. May send it back.I'm also finding despite the hype of all these new ones saying I'm the fastest, it just isn't true, this computer isn't faster than the one I'm trying to replace. Turtle speed.
[-]Amazing computer in ALMOST every way but TERRIBLE, and I mean TERRIBLE!, battery life. Literally I have a two hour batter life, on power saver, when fully charged. TWO. HOURS. Is mine defective?!?!?!?!?!?!?
[-]The battery worked for only 2 hours even though the advertised time was an average of 7.5 hours. Pure Tricks.
[-]Ok laptop. Wouldn't call it flagship. Don't think the specs are quite accurate. Arrived ok and works fine though.
[-]The mousepad works so poorly, I may have to return the laptop. In fact, I can't get the thing to work. No double-clicking, the zoom function initiates any time I rub my finger across the mousepad. I have to use the arrows to scroll up and down a webpage because it refuses to recognize scroll bars. Not to mention the nanny functions (oh, we'll do that for you because you're too stupid, but what we're really doing is making the damn thing so hard to use, you have to have support's help) and the lagging load times. It's bad enough that I had to get a new computer. I shouldn't have to put up with the dadgum thing not working the way it's supposed to.
[-]I ordered an i phone 6s 64 GB unlocked. When I got the box I found out that the I phone 6s box contained brown colored clay and no phone or accessories. Very shocking.
[-]My package came empty waiting for a refund. No phone or accessories inside.
[-]Lower cost! People go look on Apple, you can get a 64gb for less than this
[-]No carrier can active this phone, this phone was reported lost and stolen.
[-]Sold me a "Blacklisted Iphone 6s 128gb" !! Very disappointing and embarrassing taking it to my carrier and finding out it's stolen ! BEWARE
[-]Come one... Money doesn't easily we need ... I need my money back... You said unlocked and sent me locked mone and with a simcard inside (like used phone). In my country I can not use that; the phone can not be used with my national SIM card
[-]We purchased phone as an unlocked device but upon receiving the phone it had T-Moble servic... My son was very upset waiting for the phone so patiently. We will no longer purchase any merchandise from this vendor
[-]I was sold a fake phone. The IMEI number is not even registered with Apple in the USA. The IMEI and model numbers in the box did not match the settings on the phone. The storage size was 16gb and not 64gb. What a rip off!
[-]Blocking this cell and seller to date is waiting for me to solve. He tells me to wait but I buy an unlocked phone and have no need to go through this
[-]Phone came in a sealed box as advertised. Sim card removal tool missing and an active AT&T sim card in it. Waiting to hear from the company about a resolution. Amazon makes plenty of money! Seems to me they should weed the crooks out of their site. My last two purchases have been terrible experiences. And as the way of the world nowadays-----No One seems to take responsibility! Always someone else's fault.
[-]Bought Quilted Northern at Costco and it was far superior to anything I had previously used. The rolls were huge and the tissue was thick. When I saw it on Amazon I decided to buy it in bulk. What I got was small rolls with very thin tissue. I am extremely disappointed !
[-]Ahh ha - so it's not just me!!! Others have experienced the same quality issues with Quilted Northern UltraPlush. I bought the first 12-roll pack of UltraPlush at Costco, butt not for the price, or the size, or the square feet, or the number of rolls. I bought "UltraPlush" because I thought it might be "kinder" for someone with a medical issue. It worked; it was remarkably gentle, plus it had other positive qualities!!! Sadly, however, I've not seen the same product in Costco since. Amazon seemed to be the solution, so with high expectations I bought a big carton. The stuff that arrived was nothing like the original product. Such a disappointment!!! It seems customers were ButtBaited by the original quality product, and then came the company's "cost saving" change. Fool me once, butt never again!!!
[-]Do your research, I unfortunately didn't. Borderline offensive what you get for the price, imo. NOT A GOOD DEAL AT ALL (imo). $15.99 at costco for more than twice the amount (Kirkland brand). Kirkland may not be as soft, but certainly an overall better deal/product.
[-]Extremely fast shipping but the product is very low in quality overall. It is very different than the original ultra Plush double rolls from the Store. The item I received is very light weight, smaller in size and low quality overall. Not recommended to buy it here.
[-]I've owned this watch for about 3 years. Get compliments on it all the time. However, the Sentry is prone to have mechanical issues (google it). The day gets stuck and does not work after some time (can not be adjusted either). Something mechanical is going on with the watch. It also causes the watch to not keep time correctly (battery is new). Now my watch sporadically tells the correct time. On top of that Nixon wants $45 to send it in and get it fixed (out of warranty), no thanks. This will be my last Nixon time piece. Sad because i really like the design.
[-]I followed the instructions out of box to set day. The day did not remain accurate for longer than 12 hours. Tried it the way it is described in these reviews (midnight as opposed to setting it at noon) also didn't work. It took me a while to remember to set it on a night I happen to be awake and home at noon. Now I'm two weeks out of my exchange period. I have soo many watches I paid far less for and did no research on and pulled no tricks to set the day window and they remain accurate for years from the initial setting. Very disappointed with the brand. I should had listened to the reviews. It's a looker, but, also an expensive paper weight.
[-]I'm only giving one star because i have to in order to write something. This product came to me in Chinese.  The directions after translating and by looking at the image stated to remove cap. Looking at my product i notice there wasn't a cap. what the heck.  it said the pink indicator will turn clear. Never did.  This product does not work. Do not listen to the other &#34;great reviews&#34; like i did. Big mistake.
[-]It worked OK for me. It took off more of my mascara than I expected. It seemed to slightly make a difference on my lashes but no one was able to notice the difference. I'm still a little sketchy about the heat near my eye. It also didn't come with a battery, so it is not ready to use out of the box. I think my regular eyelash curler worked better.
[-]after reading the positive reviews i thought id give it a try. after several frustrating attempts i gave up. it didnt do anything for my lashes, not even a tad bit. i even held it longer on my lashes, nothing. tried it before and after mascara, no luck.
[-]Product was not sent as advertised.  No lid was included with unit and it does not heat up enough to curl lashes.  I read reviews and was very excited to get it but it did not heat up at all on number 1 and very little on number 2.
[-]Don't believe the good reviews for this curler. First, the product I received was not made by the stated manufacturer, but instead was produced by a company called &#34;zlime.&#34; I figured, well, okay, that doesn't mean that it doesn't work, right? I turned it on, heated it up, curled the lashes of one eye, and ... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I did it again. Then I repeated it once more, just to be sure. I finally called my husband into the room. He stared at my one (allegedly) curled eye and said, &#34;I don't get it.&#34; So there you have it - different product/manufacturer, zero effect, confused husband. I wish that I had set fire to my money instead, it would have at least been more entertaining.
[-]This is a horrible product, most of the reviews are fake and it didnt work. Its basically like buying water in a small bottle for more money then its worth. Not impressed 0/10
[-]I don't know what's up with these other reviews, but this did absolutely nothing for me. The oil doesn't get absorbed, it just sits on my skin and I end up looking like I haven't washed my face in weeks.
[-]i did not liked moroccan argan oil.it should not be for hair, face  , skin Anti Wrinkle, Anti Aging, Anti Oxidant, Moisturizer and Conditioner for Dry Skin & Cuticles.what it is like all in one? i dont think so. it is not what i expected but you could give  try Natural Beauty Brand Argan Oil , when  you don&#8217;t see results you wanted , don&#8217;t be surprised.
[-]This product did not help at all, after applying it I noticed I had no progress what so ever. I basically paid for water. I'm very disappointed in this product. I highly recommend you look elsewhere if you're looking for good argan oil.Very disappointed. Very BAD product, do not recommend this product to anyone.
[-]I bought this for my wife, as she loves using natural products on her skin and hair. She only used it a couple of times and was not impressed. She complained that she saw no benefits and she can not get pass the smell. Now we have more than half a bottle that will go to waste.
[-]My husband bought this for me, for me to use on my skin. I have used it for close to a month now, and see no change/benefit. The biggest issue I have is with the smell. I have used other Argan oils that didn't smell this bad.
[-]This is really a disappointment for me personally. In the past i had used other products sold by Natural World but this didn't meet my expectations at all. I have put the oil on my hands to test it out but later in the day my hands dried out and it doesn't fell right and natural.
[-]Do not buy this item if you are trying to help your dry skin. One because I can't get past the smell, makes my skin really itchy and irritated, and worst of all greesy. I thought it would work, but it didn't work at all. Instead of it doing what it's suppose to be doing, it does the complete opposite. I do not recommend this product for anyone to use.
[-]The oil did not work for me at all. I tried using the oil on all areas where i had dry skin, and to my surprise, the skin was still dry, and even more flakier than usual. I started to build up rashes on those areas. This doesn't work for my hair either, since when I tried it, my hair hardened, and I couldn't wash it out with soap and water. I had to purchase this special lubricant to get the oil out and soften my hair back to normal. I don't think this oil is very good, as it gave me a lot of stress.
[-]Well after reading the positive reviews I moved to order the product and received it in 2 weeks. It was really terrible experience while receiving the product and also I can't explain result after using the product.It's a totally crap product just waste of money.
[-]This toy worked only once, and then we had to toss it. The winding string jammed, and the plastic pull on the end of the string was a choking hazard for babies and small children.
[-]It is not as "active" as I expected. Kind of cheap plastic toy.
[-]With this SanDisk Ultra 16GB USB 3.0 OTG Flash Drive, I also ordered micro USB Connector For Android Mobile Devices. But with this pack, I couldn't found that micro USB Connector For Android Mobile Devices, it was missing with that part. So, I want to return that & would get back my money, so what can I do now, please help?
[-]Used pendrive was sent. Also it gets heated up.like anything even on a data transfer of 2 gb. Pathetic pendrive
[-]I bought SanDisk Ultra 16GB USB 3.0 OTG Flash Drive in a Lightning Deal, thought it will be a good addition to my New Laptop (with 2 USB 3.0 ports) Accessory.After using it I am very much disappointed now. If I plug it in Laptop I am not able to use another USB 3.0 port beside it.The Design of this Device is a Problem.Please check your Machines for similar issue, before buying it.Better buy a good quality 16 GB USB Drive and an OTG cable, thats a better combination, compare to it.
[-]The pen drive is really small and good to carry easily. Since it's small, there is a possibility of loosing it quickly. So you will have to keep track of it.Read and write speed was satisfactory for a USB 3.0 device, but what I did not like about the pen drive was that the slider was too sloppy. Whenever you try to insert it in USB or in an OTG supported phone (I have a Moto G2), it feels like the device is not completely inserted, and the actual connector/otg side tends to move inside. I have had troubles with my laptop recognizing this pen drive and so does my mobile.To my latest horror, I had a crucial data in it when my laptop started showing the device as corrupt. I had to format it at last to return it safely.
[-]Size is 28 gb and NOT 32 gb as advertised. MRP is 975/- and NOT 1499/- as advertised so technically you are NOT getting a 50% discount on this product.
[-]I just received this product for my Nexus 6P. I earlier asked the seller whether it supports Nexus 6P or not?? He replied that Yes. But after receiving the product I realize that it is not a C Type Usb otg. For that reason it doesn't support in my Nexus 6p. This type of wrong information is not expected from Amazon or its sellers.Product is good. It works smoothly on my LG G3.
[-]OTG does not work on my Micromax mobile Nitro and where as product says it works on Andriod devices and checking further on SanDisk website it has list of mobile phone which it supports, so buyers beware. I did not find any mention of the same in amazone that it will support very few mobiles. I am not happy customer . I am not sure there will be any replacement or money refund.
[-]Shows blank sd card on connecting to samsung note 2 and is the same even on formatting asked for refund....
[-]Build quality is terrible and speeds are just about at par with a USB 2.0 drive. Not recommended at all.The plastic is very cheap and brittle and switching between OTG and full-size USB connector is clunky. To top it off, write speeds barely exceeded 10mbps even when connected to a USB 3.0 port.
[-]Problematic connecting it to a computer or phone , as the toggle switch lock slips and has to be physically held in place to be inserted into USB.
[-]This product will feel very poor quality. Very flimsy plastic.Product working fine as USB thumb drive, no longer works as OTG (may be just me), tried on Moto G3, G2, Zenfone.Requested a refund, not yet got one (Not even came to collect the product) Disappointed by product and service.
[-]Though OTG is good feature, this device is not good. Issue is with slider which got loose within first week of purchase. And since slider lock was not working properly, it is hard to connect this device with laptop.I had returned it and now looking for another device without slider.
[-]This item is defective as this is not working well with my Moto g3 mobile ,when I connect it to mobile and transfer some data in few seconds it shows device removed so I can't use this item .and also I can't delete/ paste data to this from my laptop Sony . so this item is useless for me.
[-]It's automatically removed when we are adding or copying something. Sometime it's take long time to connect and few seconds it's removed automatically. Don't know whats the problem with this, even I have checked this other mobile phone as well.
[-]Guys dont buy this pendrive. Usb 3.0 is just for name it has very low transfer rates just like a normal pendrive sometimes even low, its transfer speed changes very much and dont have a constant tranfer rate go for hp if you want 3.0 pendrive.
[-]I am copy BAHUBALI 1080p with 4.29GB file size and free space of pan drive is 14.2GB but it is not copy in drive and show an error file is to large for the destination file system..... please solve this problam aur replace pan drive
[-]Faltu and worst..it gets very very very heated during using
[-]Product is the worst.! Very poor build quality and performance. The slider doesn't stay in place and the housing can rip apart at any moment. Please don't buy it at any cost. I had to return mine within 2 days.!
[-]Oh.. bad experience with such a good brand. I had to return it in couple of days as the pendrive was not getting detected on my machine. Thanks to Amazon for the smooth return policy in place.
[-]Defective product...Customer care is pathetic... Dont waste your money.Was thinking of a cheaper option to back up data..finally I bought WD passport Ultra and is highly satisfied...
[-]Not happy as SanDisk Ultra 32GB USB 3.0 OTG Flash Drive. is not working with my Samsung grand 2 mobile.also the button at then side for opening closing drives does not work properly
[-]First of all the speed of transfer in my pc is very slow around 18mb/sec, also the other port i.e OTG port to connect to smartphones is not working.really disappointed by Amazon.
[-]Used it for just 3 months and now its dead. Well it has warranty for that I have to spent my valuable time and travel expense. I would consider buying another one, not sandisk though.
[-]speed is very good but knob given on side to operate usb is not very good b`coz as i tried to insert pendrive to my laptop portion of usb gows inside because of poor locking system
[-]This works good with pc and laptop but this is not getting connected to any mobile phone. I have tried to connect it with 10 phones but it is not getting connected
[-]Otg pendrive not working, dont know who will take responsibility ,do not know whom to to contact or call, if I had purchased in shop, I would know, where to go.
[-]Pen Drive shown after 3 to 5 mins of insert for PCand Mobile hang some time when i insert to mobile /...
[-]not so good. ok product and below the expectations. OTG flash side is still not compatible with my nokia lumia and galaxy tab-4. poor product in this sense.
[-]Not compatible with every smartphone, also it gets automatically formatted if trying to copy or move files from device to it leaving a folder named lost

[-]This pendrive have a serious heating problem. Even made my mobile very hot. Returned! Will order the non otg model and use it with otg cable.

[-]The product I received is not of good quality . It's slider is not working . Very disappointed from amazon
[-]Pen drive is not in good condition and while I transfer small amount of data it hanged for so much time .
[-]OTG micro USB does not work properly. Poor design for the switch between two drives , not strong enough.

[-]please be aware ..this not usb 3.0 at all...also made up of some cheap plastic(it can not be sandisk)
[-]pendrive is not working and it's showing only 250mb data in 16gb pendrive. It is 5 year in warranty. Can you please change the pendrive
[-]Quality is not up to the mark and only support few high end phone not at all happy with product

[-]I got defective product there is no return option and response from amazon, please don't buy
[-]It gets heated, even when you use for few minutes. Doesn't works perfectly with led tv.
[-]As my expectations this device is not support in my Samsung Grand Prime Android Phone.
[-]I bought it when there was a lightening deal. The product arrived at right time. When I connected the USB in to system, the first box appeared ‘Do you want to format it”. I clicked format it and another box appeared for format disk. I clicked start and it gave warning message that all the current data’s will be erased. I clicked ok and another box appeared with the message that ‘the disk is writing protected’. I gave it to IT staff to understand the errors and they also seen the similar errors and concluded that it cannot be used further. I can understand one important aspect from this purchase that vendors would dispose all their malfunction items through lightning deal and it is big opportunity for them to dispose their dead inventory and obsolete items by attracting us with huge discount. One star also for prompt delivery and not for product.
[-]Not working with MI4, not so happy with the product as it doesnot meet the purpose!!!
[-]Not working with most devices. So it is not as described. Beware when buy at Amazon.
[-]Very poor quality, item not as described and expected. Very disappointing product.
[-]yesterday i got it but so bad product not detecting to smart phone... don't buy..
[-]very poor response did not work properly and stop working after 3 days.........
[-]the product just didnt work, also found it too delicate to handle. bad choice.
[-]The product was not working, it didn't work with my laptop nor my smartphone.
[-]write seed 5mb/s maximum & read speed 22 maximum.i used it.plz..don't buy it
[-]not at all working with my samsung galaxy prime.....i want my money back....
[-]Does not properly it is not working when i wanna make it bootable pen drive.
[-]It doesn't work ( in fact not even recognised ) with Samsung A5 . Worthless
[-]Quality of the Material used in Manufacturing the Product is Very Very Poor
[-]Bad product, not easy to use, disconnect in every 20 seconds on mobile,
[-]Perhaps I have bought and lost more than 2 dozen pen drives so fat. But never encountered such a bad one. After unpacking the item, connected to PC, which didn't detect it. Removed and inserted again and PC detected it. However, while copying items, it frequently got off and write operation failed. I couldn't even perform a full format. Checked it on my laptop as well, same problem. My PC and Laptop both have core i5 and USB3. The pen drive overheats when connecting to USB-3, while the product description mentions it to be USB 3 compatible. So, returned the item. This could be one-off defective piece case, but how come it got supplied to market?
[-]doesn't meet my expectations....wanted to replace ...very poor service
[-]Ordered for 64 gb and got 32 gb. This is.my second worst experience. I don't want to receive feedback call instead email me an d I will get back.
[-]I was so excited to try this shadow.  I saw the shade on youtube and fell in LOVE but after I bought it..It just didn't look quite as purple.  It comes off way more grey in person.  The color is a bit dry.  I wore the shadow alone for about 10 hours and it barely gave any color to my lids on its own.  I touched my eyelid to see how it was holding up and the color flaked off immediately.  I've never had such an experience and I do have other color tattoos.  In my experience the shimmery shades are much better in this line.
[-]I received a sample of this product for review.Pros:Silky soft handsSoftened Cuticles Beautifully! Cons:Smell - I just didn't like the smell but I am sensitive to smells. However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day. I am thinking about adding a drop of some great smelling oil to it.
[-]Half of them came broken and chipped
[-]Disappointing. The brush is really hard to get ANY product on your lashes!! I liked the L'Oreal Butterfly (waterproof) Mascara A LOT better!! There's no way that you can make your lashes look like the commercial or even half way close with that stupid brush! It took me awhile to find the waterproof version (I can't wear non-waterproof mascaras).UPDATE as of July 9, 2014: I took an AVON mascara brush (from Daring Curves mascara) & cleaned it thoroughly with Maybelline Expert Eyes Waterproof makeup remover & then washed it with soap & water & let it dry overnight. Tonight, I took the brush & popped it into the tube of L'Oreal Manga Waterproof Mascara and wound up with beautiful LONG lashes & not clumped together like the commercial. I could get the product on my lashes where it belonged. L'Oreal needs to get rid of the brush for this mascara!!!! It would actually be a good mascara then!!
[-]It's not oily or greasy which is what I like. The serum just sits heavy on my skin. I also broke out very bad so I don't recommend this for people with sensitive skin.
[-]Pros:1) Glides on super-smooth.2) A perfectly-pigmented purple (reference: NC20)3) Price point.Cons:1) Formula smudges too easily! Primer not optional, unless all you're going to use this for is the smokey look.2) You go through the pencil pretty fast, since the &#34;lead&#34; is so soft.
[-]Good product but the description says non-whitening but it goes on very white and stays white! My kids look like ghosts. I am rating it down only for the misleading description.
[-]L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation has a broad-spectrum SPF 18.  It claims to &#34;Instantly blur lines, spots and ueven texture for younger looking skin in just seconds.  Skin feels touchably soft and smooth.&#34;When wearing L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation, my skin feels as smooth as it usually does whether I wear foundation or not.  The texture of L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation reminds me of moisturizer; fairly thin.While L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation is not thick and overwhelming to my skin, it's coverage isn't as good as it claims and not as good as other foundations that I've tried.  I have melasma spots and L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation doesn't cover my spots well and it doesn't stay on my face all day.  I don't have too many wrinkles and the wrinkles that I do have don't appear to blur at all.I received L'Or&eacute;al Paris Visible Lift Blur Foundation from SheSpeaks for free in exchange for an honest review.
[-]i absolutely hated it it useless it looks like im trying to 5 again at dance recital and im 20 it doesn't  flatter my skin at all , i would really appreciated if i could have my money back i would give them 5 stars if i get refunded for great costumer service.
[-]I was extremely excited to try these Velvitines although i was unsure because of the Lime Crime controversies. I purchased it anyway and i was surprised by how small the tube was for the price. When i first applied it i thought it smelled and felt like those cheap lip glosses you get when your young. The initial color is however beautiful. I wouldn't call it a burgundy but a deep red. This lip-stain does bleed horribly, even with lip liner its quite messy. I constantly need to be checking my lips and cleaning excess product around my mouth. For the price you can find a better brand.
[-]The color is beautiful but it does not stay on how reviews said. But I love the mat look. I just thought it would stay on for a long time.
[-]I've bought lip stick after lipstick looking for the perfect shade of rose red and this is it. It applies so smooth (and smells like a cupcake batter of some sort). The finish look is so flawless and light and it feels like you have nothing on. It look best for the first hour you use it and after a while it feels a little too dry. Also , it begins to get a little messy in the area that goes on your inner lips because it gets dry and the moisture makes it feather a bit. It's best to use when you're not going to eat or anything of the sort because if it gets messy it will be a disaster. It's also a little harder to remove than most lipsticks because the color really sticks to your lips. It's not my every day lipstick but more for special occasions.But no lipstick is perfect and I still consider it good. The color and smooth look of it still makes me somewhat satisfied
[-]Because of all the hype, I decided to try the velvetines out despite my best judgment. I knew matte products did not suggest that it should be moisturizing. As a matter of fact, you'd be lucky if it wasn't drying..I have dry lips, its not always cracked nor bleeding, but pretty dry most of the time. even the revlon lip butters aren't moisturizing enough if i don't put a hydrating lip balm on top first. so i was just praying it wouldn't peel on me and it luckily it didn't, but i honestly believe this was the case since i purchased this dark color, so any dryness wouldn't jump out at you right away. and because I was working that day and consistently talking to customers when i tested this out, i put on a clear gloss which completely ruined the idea of a matte gloss..lol anyhow, for the product itself on normal hydrated non-problematic lips, I can completely understand the fascination and obsession with these as they are pretty darn revolutionary. they go on so pigmented almost like a stain, and its matte so its that much more true to its color and it's lightweight. think of it as a much more intense benitint and more viscous, but not close enough to what you'd think a gloss would feel like
[-]Hydraulic fluid leaked all over while it was shipped.  Missing covers from holes.  No tool in there to put it together thankfully I have a set of them.  Try making instructions better.
[-]I was definitely not a fan of the product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
[-]This product has done nothing to cure my dry skin if anything it has made it worse, and it makes my hair look horrendous. This product was a waste of my time and money and I wish I did not buy it. Would never recommend this to anyone regardless of their situation. Take your money elsewhere.
[-]After using this product for a month I have not seen any changes. Would not recommend at all, don't waste your time or money.
[-]This  Moroccan Argan Oil was nothing like I expected. I will not purchase this again. It didn't work that well for me. Hope it works for others.
[-]A little does go a long way! I have naturally curly hair that gets frizzy in the humidity. This didn't really help the frizz, it just made my hair greasy and weighed down. I couldn't use it on my face because I don't like the smell. I put it on my nails and It was somewhat moisturizing.
[-]Do Not Buy What a Rip Off Dried Out My skin and it look like i had a sunburn it burnt my skin and made it really dry
[-]it's not unscented, it has a natural smellwhich i don't like.will look for an unscented oil instead of this.
[-]Did not working for me at all. I expected much from this but get nothing.This product dispointed me so not worth to buy stay away from it.
[-]this product did not help at all. it sucks and is a terrible product. I did not see any changes at all for me.
[-]It's the best product If you want to waste your money. I hardly buy it because of huge good reviews and I guess it's going great, but result are not great for my skin. Waste of money or nothing. Not Recommended
[-]I tried the product but it did NOT work as expected. I used it for like a month and I got pimples. I never had any issue of pimple before I started this. It may have those great natural stuffs, which I DONT Care now since this had side-effects - at least not for me. So my only advice to the buyers.. keep this point in mind that it may also happen.
[-]Not very happy with this product. Didn't do what I expected.  Left skin/hair kind of greasy. have used products similar to this (moroccan argan oil)  on hair and got great results but this didn't hack it.  just cannot recommend at this time.
[-]Very unhappy with this product as it seemed to irritate my skin in a waythat don't want to experience. Yes, we all don't have the same skin type but it's not for me.
[-]Says its organic but docent have USDA organic label. Does have Expiration dates and manufacturing lot numbers so thats good. Smells like other legit Argan oils I have used.
[-]Got this a week ago and i'm really disappointed. A little does go a long way! I have naturally curly hair that gets frizzy in the humidity. This didn't really help the frizz, it just made my hair greasy and weighed down. I couldn't use it on my face because I don't like the smell. I put it on my nails and It was somewhat moisturizing. I will not purchase this again.
[-]I got this for my girlfriend. She insists on only using the healthiest organic products. Her birthday was coming up so I decided to get her a couple of bottles of this oil because it says it's good for hair, face and nails I figured she would get lots of use out of it.There was a slight film on the top of the oil so it's recommended you shake it before using so it all gets mixed up properly.The main problem with this product is A) the smell which smells like nuts or trees but it's really kind of overpowering. my girlfriend didn't like it. B) the product is greasy. I mean sure.. it's an oil but it takes way to long to absorb into the skin. when my girlfriend applied it to her face it she looked all shiny (or should I say greasy) for the next few hours until she wiped it off.Overall we weren't impressed, the only upside is the product is organic. If you insist on using organic products you might be happy with it. if you're used to the quality regular cosmetics you probably wont like it.
[-]Awefull, it did'nt help me at all. It was a complete waste of money
[-]Bad Awful product.  I attempted to use this product and received no results.  Left rashes, and gave me a burning sensation on my skin.  I went in and had someone look at it and it is not organic
[-]Bought this item and it was useless. It did nothing for my dry skin at all and probably made it worse. Do not buy this item if you are trying to help your dry skin. I thought that because of all the good reviews that the product would be extremely good for me, but it ended up being terrible for my skin. Very dissatisfied with this product.
[-]Terrible, first it smells like something died, and second nothing happened!!! I actually started to breakout with blister like pimples that went away after about a month and a half!!!!!!!!!!
[-]Didn't give the results i expected. I have always been a fan of natural products so naturally when i cam e across this i thought it was a must have. Sadly it wasn't good at all. The Oil is really greasy and leaves a horrible sheen on your face. I had to wash it off after applying it. When i applied it to my hair it actually made my head itch. So not going to try that again. Product looked good but didn't function so well. 1 star for me
[-]DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT I BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.
[-]I have been using this product from last couple of months and i am not satisfied with the results at all. Its not 100% pure agra oil as it says , this was the worst product i have used soo far. I will not recommend anyone to use this product .
[-]My friend got it for me.. I tested it for few weeks but no good.This product did not meet my expectations. Will be looking for otheralternative then!.
[-]It worked great the first week or so, but now my hair is so greasy that i have to switch to another product. The scalp has also become very itchy. It just didn't work for me.
[-]I have never used Argan oil before so I have no comparison.  However,  I am a soapmaker and have used numerous oils and butter. This is definitely an oil that I will incorporate into my formulations. I did not notice any odor and the oil quickly absorbed into my skin. The end feeling was very soft and silky. I cant wait to try it in facial soaps. I must also include that I was provided a coupon code so I received this product for free. While I think this is a great product, as a soap and skincare manufacturer, I would never pay this much for a 4oz bottle of argan oil. So great prduct, but not so much at a great value.
[-]I don't recommend for anyone to use this product. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and i have seen almost to none results at all. I don't think this is pure at all. Don't waste your time and money, you can find something better.
[-]Price was cheap so was very hesitant since the higher quality stuff usually more expensive.But since i have bought other products for health and skin for around this price which were as good as high quality products or better i decided to give this go.What a mistake i made picking this product after few days of use my skin was very irritated and required a doctor visit. The doctor was stumped why my skin was so irritated and didn't hit me the only that was changed from my normal routine was using this product. I would not recommend this product.
[-]This id the worst product i have tried so far . i have been using this product from last 2-3 months and no results yet, its not pure product as mention in the description. I would like to aware you all to not waste your money and time using this product you can search for better products on amazon they might be costly but they are effective .. This one is total waste of time and money.
[-]I tried this item before and it didnot give the results i expected.  Not that great of a product at least for the cost as i feel there are other products better out there.
[-]This product does not work and feels very artificial on the skin.I would highly advise against this product and get something that works and feels more natural.
[-]I really didn't like the feel of back side of the cover. Not at all worth 500 bucks.
[-]I was charged my tab for 5 hrs but didn't get at least 70% of battery............
[-]Already giving problems.
[-]The delivered tampered glass was good but it was not sticking to whole screen...
[-]Lot of bubbles were left behind, waste of money.
[-]it is waste not size curect totally waste
[-]The router is continous on after sometime the router will be hang
[-]Wrong product description in webpage as Series TL-WR841N V8 (Version 8). The product delivered was Ver 9.2. It wont support DD WRT.
[-]As everybody had a good review for TPLINK routers I too purchased the same and now regretting.1. As soon as you turn it on it will start producing high pitch sounds. (irritating when your room is silent)2. Transmission goes down anytime, earlier I used to blame my provider but later I found it was this holy s***3. Latest one: router started making 'tick tick' sound and when I checked this crap I saw LAN indicators blinking even though nothing was connected on that respective port.4. With reference to above the LAN is completely defunct now, and wireless is somehow working and that too intermittent.5. On the top of that, Service is the worst of all: I am told to visit Vasai (my residence is Kharghar) just to get this product checked. Where I have to travel through all that hell. Very limited centers and no assurance.Never go for this chinese product, its all about luring the customers to buy this s***.
[-]just to let you know, ive bought this router a month ago, initially it was fine but after 3 weeks it started givng problems, i configured and reboot couple of times where the problem wasnt solved and the same issue where no pages were, i tried the d link router and it started working fine, i called Tp link customer service where they asked me to configure again and i did that again where the problem wasnt solved, cus care asked me to call a number for kolkata service centre where the eprson picked up and told me to call after a week as they are setting up the place, still looking for a place, i am now without any router, this is the true face of TP Link, where D Link and Netgear is far far faaaar better, please never buy any Tp Link product, worse exp ever!!!
[-]I ordered it from amazon got in just 2 days without any extra charges, thanks to amazon.But I m highly dissapponted by product first of all its range not meeting as mentioned by people if one wall also comes signal strength reduces to 2 points, after one week of using the product got malfunctioned its led for internet continues glow inspite i have unplugged the network cable(perhaps my device is faulty one) and internet doesnt working at all, then I return this product to amazon thanks they have returned my money (they told they will in 2 or 3 days).....
[-]Don't buy it.. I used it for 7 days..Signal strength varies widely & sometimes there's signal loss for 2-3 hours. I installed it in the ground floor. Even on 1st floor ( < 30 meters) the signal weakens. Waste of money. Refunded item.
[-]This router has been troublesome since day 1. The wireless connectivity suddenly drops and i need to reset the router to connect again. Used to happen every few times a day. I then packed this & started using my 3 year old tiny Beetel work horse. I kept this away packed meaning to get it repaired. In the past few days again I tried this piece & it still dropped wireless connectivity twice in half a day. This is really poor in terms of quality. And the only reason I had bought this was the higher rating on Amazon. Disappointed.
[-]Very disappointing. Worst product with very bad signal strength. Not enough for even 2 bedroom flat. Not sure if the product design is bad or the instrument is bad, but the purpose of buying 300MBPS with 2 antennas is defeated with this product. Even if I come out of room just outside with door closed, there is no signal. If you move away more than 20 Feet there is no signal no connectivity. I seriously regret buying this product. Please do not buy if you want decent range to the wifi.
[-]worst product, have purchased it just one month ago. Though initially it was working good but suddenly it stopped to receive signals. I visited to service center as it was under warranty period. The service personnel received the product and assured to replace it after 15 days. The service person also offer another used set so as to uninterrupted work until the original was replaced, but unfortunately when I returned home and engaged it to the system the same was not respond at all.
[-]As if it isn't disappointing enough to receive this cheap plastic piece of junk after freaking twenty Five days, this scrape box stopped working the second day!!! Serious Amazon??!!..it is probably my mistake to presume that USA e-store giant would keep up its integrity and credibility in India as well. A word of advice, select your dealers with caution if you intend to woo your users. The star is just for the decent customer care hotline you guys have, unlike the junk that you sell.
[-]The worst product EVER!!!! When this product came, it had a really good range and speed and now it's been only 2 months, the range and speed BOTH have dropped to a very serious extent!!!I didn't expect such low quality since TP- LINK has a good name.....but I personally would NOT RECOMMENDED this product to anyone at all!!!!
[-]Although this works ok for occasional emails/browsing -- I found speed and quality of connection get dropped while using vpn/continuosly -- as compared to dlink dir 605 which i used earlier -- in which connection quality was fantastic and never dropped and could download movies even with net download speeds of 20/32 kbps . Am disappointed with quality of connection and performance of this box.
[-]Very poor quality of WiFi Range, I have order it looking at 2 antennas but wifi rage is very poor. I will not suggest to buy this router if you are looking for good WiFi coverage. I am getting very poor coverage out of my 10 X 10 ft room. Think twice before you buy. It not even worth for Rs 1055 which I got on deal. This is cheap quality router... I will suggest to go with other router.
[-]Was a defective product. My ACT broadband is 20MBPS. This wifi router output was 0.15 MBPS. Now running around with the Painful replacement process. The only TP LINK OFFICE IN CHENNAI does not accept the machine ON SATURDAYS. not sure if they expect every customer to take a week day leave to go submit the machine.Absolutely inconvenient. Poor poor TP LINK SERVICE.
[-]90% of TP-Link product are defective, i too had a defective router , i went to replace it at main service center at Vasai(mumbai). they gave me replacement from Buffer stock ( they repair the defective piece and give it as replacement, not the same one that v submit ). replaced router is also defective. we should take tp-link company to court.
[-]Streaming of Videos is just bad also the overall wifi speed is less, i was getting better speed over my Old N150 Belkin router. Adding to it there's no customer service for this thing i had an issue of not being able to create password for WiFi i tried contacting TP customer care like for 2 hrs and there's no response. Pathetic experience.
[-]Product have range problem- in 2 BKH flat in mumbai - if this routhwr is install in enteance hall then fine ,but in side your Room - this product is fail- no network- AMAZONE sld stop selling TP LINK BRAND product immedialty on their webside-platform- OTHERWISE it will impact AMAZONE BRAND-ty r seeling faulty product
[-]The router was working fine for a month, after which it stopped working suddenly. I couldnt connect to the internet.My internet service provider told me that the router had a problem, and proved it by connecting his own router.Bad product, and not recommended.I am not sure about the warranty either/
[-]Absolute useless product..! Range might be good.. But the connectivity sucks big time. Constant connection drops, inconsistent wifi connectivity is the biggest issue with this TP Link router. Better invest some more and get a good router, may be D Link or Netgear or Asus for that matter. Avoid this product.
[-]Not upto the mark. Though it is a double antenna router at a little distance its signal is getting weak or it is unable to connect. And even in front of the router it is unable to get full signal. Tried to replace the router but i was unable to do so. Sometimes I ponder they are selling defected items.
[-]Bought this based on all reviews here and have been burnt. Not literally, but figuratively. The signal keeps dropping like there's a wavelength issue. Every time we switch back to our old router everything is great. But when we put this back on same problem. So have had to discard it. Waste of money.
[-]I had purchase in sep2014 and also get port error means MAC ID not showing in system in few month but this time, past 4-5 days not showing MAC ID to my ISP provider, & he said to me "your Router MAC ID Not showing on my system for reset MAC ID", I have to get very bad Experience from TP-LINK
[-]The installation was quite difficult as the web link for installation does not work, so difficulty in setting up with wifi connectivity, had to plug in a lan cable and then allow my pc to detect it and then install...if TP link cannot even run a website properly, whey are they selling routers????
[-]I bought this router recently thinking that it would support 60Mbps speed provided by ACT Fibernet.But to my disappointment, speed of wireless internet using this router was 20Mbps(tested by speedtest.net) though I was getting ~60Mbps when laptop is directly connected to the cable.
[-]No service support from TP Link. Especially in kerala only one service center at cochin .Even if it has three year warranty,for replacement we have to courier product the to Mumbai office and courier charge is paid paid by us (Rs 150 in professional courier).Better to avoid buying this.
[-]The product worked fine in the first month of use. But now it started acting weird. It connects to internet for 2 minutes and the disconnects(I will have to restart the router again to connect). And I also heard about dd-wrt firmware but I think I should go for the warranty.
[-]Poor quality product supplied.MTNL wifi router of my neighbour is far better than this.Very weak signal in another room and is lost in another.Cannot give coverage even to a 2 bhk flat of mine.Frequent disconnectivity is also there.Asked for replacement.
[-]this router is not good, i bought after reading the review from other customer, i am not getting the consistent speed with this, after few hours speed will be very less, i can check the good speed with the cable directly but this router will give very less speed.
[-]I'm very unhappy with my purchase, there router disconnect regular on it's own, at first I thought that the is some problem with my service provider but then I used another router from a friend and it worked fine, it would be great if you'll can replace this.
[-]Network signal is just 1 bar at 10 feet and once moved beyond 10Ft its completely dead.I was busy all these days and missed return option now.I am not sure where to contact or no instructions given.Given 1 star for sending defective product
[-]Router stopped working after 10 days. There are no service centers and their phone and email support isn't upto mark.They are asking for log and I can't access the router as it stopped working. Go for D link, which has door pickup for replacement.
[-]I am very much disappointed with the performance of bought product as the TP Link Router is not suitable to Sign In to Yahoo.Com which is confirmed by trouble shooter of computer. Please replace it since I need Sign In to Yahoo Mail regularly.
[-]I had to reset the router as am getting error "Page cannot be displayed " .Internet Explorer found the problem with router connectivity issues and suggested to reset the router , this is a brand new router but still had to reset it.
[-]Worst quality continues disconnection problem and amazon provide only 10 days replacement guarantee. I am facing this problem after 15-20 days after buy, so can't do anything. But this kind of quality never expecting from you Amazon
[-]This router has poor range and keeps dropping signal as well. Even sitting within 5 feet of it I didn't have full signal. I have returned it and gone back to my 5 year old Netgear router which has much better coverage than this.
[-]Not a good product.. Took days to set it up and also the internet gets disconnected on its own but the wifi stays on. If i plug my LAN to my pc everything works fine but dont understand y the Internet gets disconnected on WiFi.
[-]hell with u amazon.i have been waiting for long so that u pick up ur defected item... bt there was no pickup as well as no replacement.. what m i going to do with this defected router? give me a solution as early as possible
[-]This is not working properly it is not good product I completely setup but it is not provide lone range even i use so near but it is not working properly...i think not don't buy pls i want to give back pls return money...
[-]modem was god but the usage is low the data is becoming low while using modem throuugh wifi and but I returned to seller because of data trouble and but seller didn't give any refund of Rs1299 till the date on 25/11/2014
[-]The signal keeps dropping atleast 4-5 times in a day which is just unacceptable. I had hoped that its going to be a good router but its been just a disappointment and I am thinking of buying another one to replace this.
[-]Specs show VERSION 8 but I received VERSION 9(this was important as I had a specific requirement). You cannot mess up with the specs, not cool Amazon.Otherwise the product should be quite okay, didn't use it.
[-]After every 30 minutes it is getting disconnected. I need to switch it off and on it. I suggest not to buy this item. I will be replacing it due to the defected product.
[-]The range is not enough capable ... Not even satisfied with the speed ... I am having one more d link route one antena that is too good compare to this one ... I want to replace it or i want my money back ...
[-]Its not working.;.....for 3days it was ok but after dat.. .its not working at all. I tried To call costumer care and want to return it but I cant...plz this product s not working tell me how can I return it
[-]Service of Amazon is excellent. Unfortunately, product is not that good. I would suggest to buy standard router from reputed brands like Linksys, Dell etc. These chinese products really does not do the job.
[-]Poor network coverage.... And power supply makes sound
[-]Received the product a day late. However the packing was good. But the router failed to configure ... Bad experience with a defected product. Waited so long for it and finally received a faulty product.
[-]Guys this work grt at the first. But if try reset this router it would allow you to log in the router page. so make sure u do this test with in return period or wht u have there is a peice of junk....
[-]Wifi is not working on laptops(multiple laptops) with this router. Working fine on mobiles though. Upgraded my firmware but still same issue. 5 stars for Amazon for its deal and timely delivery.
